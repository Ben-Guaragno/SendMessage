# SendMessage
Send Message app for Fitbit Versa and Ionic

This is a fork of @PeterSumm's original SendMessage app. My modified version adds the ability to include location data (and other relevant location information) in the web requests. I also added a blast mode, which allows identical requests to be sent to multiple URLs with one tap. I also changed how success and failure is reported to the watch app, resulting in clearer results for the end user.

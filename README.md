# SendMessage
Send Message app for Fitbit Versa and Ionic

This is a fork/rework of @PeterSumm's original SendMessage app.

My modified version adds several new features:

- The ability to include location data in messages, along with accuracy and location data time
- A blast mode to send identical requests to multiple URLs
- Success and failure are reported more clearly to the user
- User selectable colors for the three buttons
- Persistence of some user-settings on the watch to reduce load times
